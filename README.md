# Let'em Cook

Let'em Cook is a full-stack recipe sharing application that enables users to share their favorite recipes, browse others' recipes, create meal plans, and generate grocery lists. Built with TypeScript and Refine framework, Let'em Cook is a great example of a modern, performant, and scalable MERN stack application.

You can visit the deployed version of Let'em Cook at [https://letem-cook.netlify.app](https://letem-cook.netlify.app/). Please note that the backend of the application is hosted on render.com's free tier, which shuts down when not in use. As a result, the application might take a few minutes to activate if it hasn't been used in a while.

## Features

Let'em Cook offers a variety of features, including:

-   Responsive design: The app is optimized for different screen sizes, so it can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   Recipe sharing: Users can create, read, update, and delete their own recipes, as well as view and save recipes created by other users.
-   Browse all recipes: Users can browse all recipes in the database, and filter and paginate the results.
-   Save recipes: Users can save recipes for future reference, and easily access them from their profile page.
-   Meal plan: Users can create a meal plan by adding recipes from their saved recipes, and view their plan on a calendar.
-   Shopping list: Users can generate a grocery list based on their meal plan, to help them plan their shopping more efficiently.

## Getting Started

If you want to run it on your local machine, please follow the steps below. 

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v14 or higher installed on your machine

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository

	`git clone https://github.com/HarryYu02/Recipe-App.git` 

2.  Install frontend dependencies

	`cd client`  
	`npm install` 

3.  Install backend dependencies

	`cd ../server`  
	`npm install` 

4.  Set up environment variables
	-   Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with the following variables:

		`MONGODB_URI=<your-mongodb-uri>`  
		`CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>`  
		`CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-api-key>`  
		`CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-api-secret>`   
		`PORT=8080<or-port-of-your-choice>`

	-   Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the following variables:

		`REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>`

	-   If you are not sure how to get these API keys by yourself, you can refer to refer to this (youtube video)[https://youtu.be/k4lHXIzCEkM?si=Zlv5LN3rKSISGzQQ&t=339] from JSMastery, where I get my inspiration for Let'em Cook, on how to setup the project locally, it includes the detail steps on how to setup MongoDB, Cloudinary, and Google OAuth with Refine, and store those API keys into the client folder's .env.local, and server's .env file. Specifically, you will want to check out the [Setup](https://youtu.be/k4lHXIzCEkM?si=Zlv5LN3rKSISGzQQ&t=339), and the [Backend Setup](https://youtu.be/k4lHXIzCEkM?si=Zlv5LN3rKSISGzQQ&t=6520) chapters.  

5.  Change the base url in /client/src/App.tsx
    -  Search and modify all instances of https://letem-cook-backend.onrender.com to your localhost, for example, http://localhost:8080

6.  Start the backend server

	`cd server`  
	`npm run start` 

7.  Start the frontend server

	`cd ../client`  
	`npm run dev` 

8.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to see the app
